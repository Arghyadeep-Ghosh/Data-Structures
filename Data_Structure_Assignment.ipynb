        "Ans)In Python, a list is a collection data type that is ordered, mutable, and can hold a heterogeneous mix of elements.\n",

        "ii)Mutable: Lists can be changed after creation. You can update, add, or remove elements within a list.\n",

        "Ans) Use Cases of Tuples and Sets in Python Programming are as follows :\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples -\n",
        "i)Immutable Data Structures: Tuples are used to store collections of data that should not be modified.\n",
        "  This immutability is useful for representing fixed sets of values that should remain constant, such as coordinates or fixed configurations.\n",
        "ii)Data Integrity: Since tuples are immutable, they provide a guarantee that the data will not be altered accidentally, which is important for data integrity in many applications.\n",
        "iii)Dictionary Keys: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable and immutable. This allows you to use complex data structures as dictionary keys, unlike lists.\n",
        "iv)Return Multiple Values: Functions often return tuples to provide multiple values at once. This is a common practice for functions that need to return\n",
        "   a result and its associated metadata or multiple related results.\n",
        "v)Structured Data: Tuples are useful for grouping related pieces of data together, such as a person's name and age, where each piece of data is a fixed attribute.\n",
        "vi)Iteration: Tuples are useful in cases where you need to iterate over pairs or groups of values. For example, when working with data from a database, tuples can represent rows of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets -\n",
        "i)Unique Collections: Sets are ideal for storing unique items and ensuring that no duplicates are present. They are often used to remove duplicates from lists or other collections.\n",
        "ii)Membership Testing: Sets provide efficient membership testing. Checking if an item is in a set is generally faster than checking membership in a list or tuple, making sets useful for fast lookups.\n",
        "iii)Mathematical Set Operations: Sets are well-suited for performing mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
        "    This makes them useful for problems involving set theory or data analysis where such operations are required.\n",
        "iv)Data Deduplication: Sets are often used to remove duplicates from a dataset. For example, when analyzing data, you can use sets to ensure that you are working with unique items.\n",
        "v)Filtering and Cleaning Data: Sets can be used to filter and clean data by easily removing unwanted or redundant elements. They provide a straightforward way to perform these operations.\n",
        "vi)Subsets and Supersets: Sets support operations to determine if one set is a subset or superset of another, which is useful for validating relationships between groups of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both tuples and sets have their own strengths and are chosen based on the requirements of immutability, uniqueness, or efficient membership testing.\n",
        "Their use cases often overlap but are distinct in terms of functionality and behavior."

        "This immutability is integral to maintaining the reliability, performance, and integrity of dictionaries, which are widely used data structures for storing and retrieving key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "i) Hashing and Key Lookup : Dictionaries in Python are implemented as hash tables. When a key is used to access a value, the dictionary computes a hash value for the key.\n",
        "                            This hash value determines where in the internal storage structure the associated value is located.\n",

        "iii) Hashability : For an object to be used as a dictionary key, it must be hashable. Hashable objects are those that have a hash value that does not change during their lifetime.\n",
